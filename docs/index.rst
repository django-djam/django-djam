   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Djam's documentation!
================================

Djam is a third-party admin with the following goals:

* Provide basic CRUD functionality similar to the current admin.
* Ease the transition by supporting auto-generation of an admin based
  on installed ModelAdmins.
* Support most of the basic ModelAdmin options out-of-the-box.
* Make it easy to add new custom areas to the admin that don't fit into the traditional CRUD model.
* Use the latest front-end tools and design patterns.

The name is alliterative; the beginning of Djam is pronounced the same as the beginning of Django.
